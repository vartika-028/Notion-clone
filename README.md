# Notion-clone

This project is a simplified clone of the popular productivity application, Notion. It's designed to replicate some of the core features of Notion, providing a platform where users can create, edit, and organize their notes in a flexible and intuitive interface.

It uses Convex as the backend, which is a real-time database that allows for instant data updates. The application also uses Edgestore, a distributed key-value store, to manage the images and files uploaded by the users.The user authentication is handled by Clerk, a secure and scalable user authentication API.
